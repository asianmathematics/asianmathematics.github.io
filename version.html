    <p>committing files to github, known issues:
    <br>gacha
    <br>- pull system needs to be reworked
        
    <br>combat
    <br>- stamina and mana values return NaN after performing an action
    <br>&nbsp;- regen function probably has something to do with it
    <br>- bullet hell button doesn't work
    <br>&nbsp;- it doesn't have a target property, so that's a first step</p>
